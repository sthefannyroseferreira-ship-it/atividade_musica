Like Suicide
Soundgarden

Heard it from another room
Eyes were making up just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide

Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck
Lays my broken gift
Just like suicide

And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her, finish her

She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide

Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide

Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide

With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you

She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide

And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her finish her

With eyes of blood and bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you

I feel for you

She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide
