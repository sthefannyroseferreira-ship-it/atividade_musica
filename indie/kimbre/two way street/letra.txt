I feel the 4 become 5
And I'm waiting, waiting, waiting
For you to walk down the boulevard and
To take me, take me, take me
But the moment you appear
You wake me, wake me, wake me
Out of the slumbers of my head
From the slums of loneliness
And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to heist me
When love is a two way street
(Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
(Love is a two way street)
We're coming close to our fate
They'll put a star beside our names
But I couldn't care for the history
When I've got you in front of me
The cars could all collide
The shards of glass won't catch my eye
Because you're almost by my side
We're counting down at the green light
And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to heist me
When love is a two way street
(Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
(Love is a two way street)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And there's no conspiracy
Behind the way to heist me
When love is a two way street
(Love is a two way street)
And I think I'm ready
To let you get under my skin
I can't make you fall for me
(Love is a two way street)
