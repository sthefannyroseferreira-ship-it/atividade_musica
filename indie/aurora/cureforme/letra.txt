I run from the liars, the fuel on the fire
I know I created myself
I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights
But I never asked for your help
You got hurt
No, we don't belong together
So you took the love from my arms
Into the arms of yours
But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't like the tension, the misapprehensions
About our own nature in love
The glorious teachers are no use for creatures
Who knows how to play with the gods
You got nerves
But they never show unless they hurt
So you blamed it all on my love
The moving heart I got
But I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
No, I don't need a cure for me
I don't need it
I don't need it
Hm, please, no cure for me
Please, no cure for me, cure for me
Cure for me, please, no cure for me, cure for me
Cure for me, please, no cure for me, cure for me, cure for me
I don't need it
(And you should know)
I don't need a cure for me
(You need to know I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me
(You need to know I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me
(You need to know I don't need it)
I don't need it
(And you should know)
No, I don't need a cure for me
