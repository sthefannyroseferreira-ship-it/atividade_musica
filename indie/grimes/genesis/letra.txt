My heart, I never be
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

My heart, I never be
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

My heart, I never be
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know

My, my, my

Ever see
Ever be
Ever know, my heart

Ever see
Ever be
Ever know, my heart

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I am the one in love

My heart, I never be
I never see
I never know
Oh, heart
And then it falls
And then I fall
And then I know
(My, my, my)

Ever see
Ever be
Ever know, my heart
(My)
Ever see
Ever be
Ever know
(My)

Home and I know
Playing the deck above
It’s always different
I am the one in love
