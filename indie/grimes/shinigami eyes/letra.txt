Shinigami Eyes
Grimes

Have you got your Shinigami eyes on?

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes on you

And young men's love doth lie
Never in their hearts
Only in their eyes
And I'm so fucking high

Rent-free in your head
Missing from your bed
I know your secrets
Everything, oh

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Evеrything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes

Arе you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes on you

But you like me the most
You follow me the most
I'm the queen upon the chessboard
And the red upon the rose

And you like me the most
You follow me the most
I'm the queen on every chessboard
I'm the setting that you export

And you can't say no

(And everything is fine)
(Got my Shinigami eyes on)
(You ready to die)
(Got my Shinigami eyes on you)

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes

Are you ready to die?
Got my Shinigami eyes on
Everything is fine
Got my Shinigami eyes on you
