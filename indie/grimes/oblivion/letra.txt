(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)

I never walk about after dark
It's my point of view (oh)
'Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you
Always coming, and you'd never have a clue

(Oh)
I never look behind all the time
I will wait forever (oh)
Always looking straight
Thinking, counting all the hours you wait

(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night (la, la, la, la)
(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night (la, la, la, la)
(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night

And no, I'm not a jerk
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand

You know it's good to be tough like me
But I will wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me
Girl, you know you've got to watch your health

To look into my eyes and tell me
(La, la, la, la, la)
To look into my eyes and tell me
(La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(La, la, la, la, la)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(La, la, la, la, la)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

See you in a dark night
See you in a dark night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
See you in a dark night

(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night
(Oh, ah, ah)
See you in a dark night (la, la, la, la)
(Oh, ah, ah)
(Oh, ah, ah)
