Don't Stop Me Now
Queen

Tonight, I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah!
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now
Don't stop me

'Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by, like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me
I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
I don't wanna stop at all

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me
Hey, hey, hey
Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh
I like it
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Have a good time, good time
Don't stop me, don't stop me

Ooh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah!
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
Don't stop me now ('cause I'm havin' a good time)
Don't stop me now (yes, I'm havin' a good time)
I don't wanna stop at all
